## Using Google Classroom with LabEx

<img width="500" src="/images/classroom-banner-2.svg" />

If you’re already using [Google Classroom](https://classroom.google.com/), you can easily share any LabEx learning materials—courses, labs, or tutorials—directly with your class. LabEx has integrated a “Share to Classroom” button, making it simple to distribute resources. Here’s how you can do it:

### How to Share LabEx Resources to Google Classroom？

#### 1. Courses

On the [course page](https://labex.io/courses/quick-start-with-linux), click the **Share to Google Classroom** button located in the right sidebar. Select the class you want to share it with and choose an action, such as "create assignment." You'll then be directed to Google Classroom to complete the process.

#### 2. Hands-on Labs

On the [lab learning page](https://labex.io/labs/linux-your-first-linux-lab-270253), click the **Share to Google Classroom** button in the top-right corner. The rest of the process is the same as sharing a course.

#### 3. LabEx Tutorials

On the [tutorial page](https://labex.io/tutorials/linux-your-first-linux-lab-270253), click the **Share to Google Classroom** button located in the left sidebar. The sharing process works just like it does for courses.

### Practical Use Cases

**1. Assign Labs for Homework**  
LabEx labs are an ideal way to provide students with practical assignments. Educators can easily share a lab as homework via Google Classroom, allowing students to apply the concepts they've learned in a hands-on environment. These labs challenge students with real-world scenarios, helping them reinforce skills and problem-solving abilities.

**2. Use Courses for Classroom Teaching**  
Instructors can enhance their teaching by pairing LabEx courses with their classroom lessons. After covering a topic, teachers can share a relevant course through Google Classroom. Students can then follow the course to strengthen their understanding, and afterward, complete labs that directly apply the concepts learned in class.

**3. Supplement Learning with Tutorials**  
LabEx tutorials are perfect for offering extra support or enrichment materials. Educators can share these tutorials to provide students with targeted help on specific topics or to extend their learning beyond the classroom. This makes it easy for students to explore new areas and deepen their knowledge independently.

By integrating LabEx with Google Classroom, educators can offer a more interactive and flexible learning experience, combining theory and practice effortlessly.
