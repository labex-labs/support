## Updated on August 30, 2024

[LabEx Teams](https://labex.io/teams) has been upgraded! Now, any LabEx user can create their own Team for free and invite students and colleagues to join. Please note that the free version of LabEx Teams allows up to 100 members. If you need to add more members or subscribe them to LabEx Pro, please contact us at `info@labex.io`.

Educators no longer need a separate application for LabEx Teams. Simply register, click on your profile dropdown, select "My Teams," and create your Team to invite students.

For more details on how to use LabEx Teams, please refer to the [LabEx Teams Documentation](https://support.labex.io/labex-teams/labex-teams-quick-start).
