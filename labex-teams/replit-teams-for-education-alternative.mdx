## LabEx Teams: A Powerful Alternative to Replit Teams for Education

With the recent announcement that Replit will no longer support its Teams for Education platform, many educators, especially in computer science, are left searching for a suitable alternative. Replit Teams for Education has been a popular tool for teachers to manage collaborative coding projects and support students' learning in programming. However, its deprecation, as outlined in the [official Replit blog post](https://blog.replit.com/update-on-teams-for-education), has led educators to seek a replacement that meets the evolving needs of tech-based education. Fortunately, LabEx Teams is here to step in as an excellent alternative.

### The End of Replit Teams for Education

In September 2023, Replit announced the discontinuation of its Teams for Education platform, leaving teachers and educational institutions in need of a new platform to support student coding projects and collaborative learning environments. The change was unexpected, and teachers who had relied on Replit's platform are now exploring other options that can offer similar, if not superior, features. Replit was appreciated for its collaborative features, but it lacked certain functionalities critical for more advanced technical subjects, especially in areas like Linux, DevOps, and machine learning.

### Why LabEx Teams is the Ideal Replacement

LabEx Teams emerges as a powerful alternative that not only replaces Replit Teams for Education but also adds significant improvements, especially for educators teaching Linux-based courses, system administration, cybersecurity, and other advanced computing topics.
Here’s why LabEx Teams stands out:

1. Comprehensive Lab Environment for Complex Scenarios

Unlike Replit, which focused mainly on coding, LabEx Teams offers a fully interactive lab environment that supports advanced technical scenarios such as Docker, Kubernetes, and machine learning. These features make LabEx an excellent tool for higher education courses and technical training. The platform provides real-world environments for students to work directly in Linux systems and complex IT infrastructure. Whether students are practicing Linux commands, configuring containers, or working with machine learning models, LabEx is designed to handle these use cases. This flexibility offers more depth than Replit’s limited infrastructure.

2. Free for Up to 100 Students

One of the biggest advantages of LabEx Teams is its affordability. The platform is completely free for teams with up to 100 students, making it accessible to many educators, from high school teachers to university professors. This is a major benefit for schools working with limited budgets, allowing them to continue offering hands-on technical education without financial strain.

3. Track Students’ Effective Learning Time (ELT)

LabEx Teams enables teachers to track each student's effective learning time (ELT) within the lab environment. This feature provides educators with detailed insights into how long students spend working on tasks in the lab, excluding time spent reading instructional content. The ability to track ELT allows teachers to monitor student engagement and progress, offering a clearer picture of each student's practical learning experience.

4. Optimized for Linux, DevOps, and Cybersecurity Education

While Replit was a great tool for general coding exercises, LabEx is specifically optimized for teaching Linux, DevOps, and cybersecurity. The platform has a wide range of ready-made labs in these areas, offering real-world, hands-on experience to students. LabEx provides all the necessary tools to teach system administration, containerization, network security, and more, making it an ideal choice for educators looking to provide their students with practical, industry-relevant skills.
