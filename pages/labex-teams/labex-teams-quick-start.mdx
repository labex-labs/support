<Accordion title="Key Concepts" icon="alien-8bit">

- **LabEx Teams Admin & Member**: The Admin oversees team learning management, while Members are learners added to the team.
- **Group**: A Group organizes Members into specific cohorts, such as 'Dev Team' or 'Test Team', for targeted learning and easy management.
- **Lab**: The fundamental learning unit, each Lab addresses particular Skills and falls under the corresponding [Skill Tree](/pages/using-labex/quick-start#skill-trees). By actively engaging in Labs on the LabEx platform, learners can acquire and master these Skills.
- **Skills**: Specific competencies that users aim to master within a [Skill Tree](/pages/using-labex/quick-start#skill-trees). By completing labs, members acquire these skills, marking their progression through the [Skill Tree](/pages/using-labex/quick-start#skill-trees).
- **[Skill Tree](/pages/using-labex/quick-start#skill-trees)**: A structured learning pathway comprised of various Skills in a specific domain. By adding a [Skill Tree](/pages/using-labex/quick-start#skill-trees) to LabEx Teams and assigning it to a Group, you guide the learning journey of Members within that Group.
