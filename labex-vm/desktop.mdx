## Desktop Preview

![Desktop Preview](/images/desktop.png)

The Desktop environment is particularly useful for:

1. Labs requiring a graphical interface, such as Linux GUI applications, code editors, and text editors, Python tools, and more.
2. Tasks that need a web browser.
3. Beginners who are not yet comfortable with command-line operations and prefer a graphical interface.

## Access the Desktop

1. If the instructor recommends using the desktop environment by default for the Lab, you'll see the desktop environment when you start it.
2. If you need to complete the Lab in a non-default desktop environment, you can switch to the desktop environment using the tabs at the top.

## Desktop Icons

On the left side of the desktop, you'll find several icons:

1. Home: Quick access to your home directory
2. Xfce Terminal: A terminal emulator for command-line operations
3. Gvim: A graphical version of the Vim text editor
4. Text Editor: A simple text editing application
5. Visual Studio Code: A popular code editor for development tasks

You can access more applications by clicking the "Applications" menu in the bottom left corner.

![Terminal](/images/20241021-16-27-06-U7E6cIom.png)

1. Look for the terminal icon on the desktop
2. Click to open a new terminal window
3. The terminal provides a command prompt where you can enter Linux commands
4. By default, the terminal uses the zsh shell

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="How can I install applications that don't exist in the environment?" icon="download">

You can use the `apt install` command to install software. The desktop environment typically uses Ubuntu 22.04, so theoretically, you can install any software compatible with Ubuntu. For example:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install package-name
```

Remember to use `sudo` for installation commands, as they require administrative privileges.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why is the environment lagging?" icon="wifi">

Environment lag can be due to several factors:

1. Local network: Ensure your local network bandwidth meets the minimum requirement of 10 Mbps.
2. Free user allocation: Free users may be assigned to our free cluster, which can experience resource constraints during peak usage.
3. Resource-intensive applications: Running applications like browsers can cause lag. Check your system's memory and CPU usage.

If you experience lag, try closing unnecessary applications and browser tabs to free up resources. If the issue persists, post a feedback message [in our community forum](https://labex.io/questions/933).

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How can I use a browser in the environment?" icon="globe">

By default, most labs don't require a browser. If you need one:

1. Open a terminal and type `firefox` to launch the browser.
2. Note that browsers consume significant CPU resources. If the lab doesn't explicitly require a browser, the system may automatically terminate browser-related processes.

Use the browser judiciously to avoid impacting system performance.

<Accordion title="How do I copy and paste in the terminal?" icon="clipboard">

We recommend using the right mouse button for copy and paste operations. Alternatively:

1. Access the View menu to see available shortcuts.
2. Default shortcuts may vary depending on your local operating system, so check the "Edit" menu for the correct shortcuts.

   For example, common shortcuts include:

   - Copy: Ctrl+Shift+C (Mac)
   - Paste: Ctrl+Shift+V (Mac)

<Accordion title="Can I save my work environment?" icon="floppy-disk">

Currently, LabEx VM does not provide an environment saving feature. There are several reasons for this:

1. Frequent updates: Our labs are regularly updated, which could lead to incompatibilities between saved environments and current lab content.
2. Maintenance costs: Storing different versions of environments for each user would significantly increase our maintenance costs and complexity.
3. Lab structure: Most of our labs consist of only 3-5 steps, making it convenient to complete them without needing to save the environment.

We've designed our labs to be concise and easily completable within a single session. If you need to take a break, we recommend noting down your progress and recreating your work environment when you return. This approach ensures you're always working with the most up-to-date lab content and tools.
