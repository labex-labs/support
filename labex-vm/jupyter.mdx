## Jupyter Interface Preview

![Jupyter Preview](/images/jupyter.png)

The Jupyter environment is particularly useful for:

1. Data analysis and visualization projects using Python libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib, etc.)
2. Machine learning and deep learning experiments
3. Interactive code execution with immediate feedback
4. Creating documented workflows combining code and markdown
5. Educational content with explanations and executable examples

## Access the Interface

1. After starting a Jupyter-enabled lab, click the "Notebook" tab at the top of the page
2. Wait for the Jupyter interface to fully load
3. You'll see the familiar Jupyter Notebook interface in your browser

## Interface Layout

The Jupyter interface consists of several key components:

1. Main Work Area:
   ![Main Work Area](/images/screenshot-20241022-GOKItmcW@2x.png)
   - Notebook cells (code and markdown)
   - Output display
   - Toolbar with common actions
2. Top Menu Bar:
   ![Top Menu Bar](/images/screenshot-20241022-LPFx7qPA@2x.png)
   - File operations
   - Cell manipulation
   - Kernel controls

## Working with Notebooks

### Cell Types

1. Code Cells:

   - Write and execute Python code
   - View output directly below the cell
   - Use Shift+Enter to execute

2. Markdown Cells:
   - Document your work
   - Add explanations and notes
   - Support mathematical equations using LaTeX

### Common Operations

1. Create new cells:

   - Click the + button in the toolbar
   - Use keyboard shortcut B (below) or A (above)

2. Run cells:

   - Click the play button
   - Use Shift+Enter
   - Use Cell menu options

3. Change cell type:
   - Use the dropdown in the toolbar
   - Keyboard shortcuts: Y (code), M (markdown)

## Usage Scenarios

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Data Analysis Sample" icon="chart-line">

<Card
  title="100 Pandas Exercises"
  icon="flask"
  href="https://labex.io/labs/100-pandas-exercises-20747"
>
  This is a sample data analysis lab that covers 100 exercises using the Pandas.
</Card>

Working with data in Jupyter:

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Read data
df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# Create visualization
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
df['column'].plot(kind='bar')
plt.title('Data Visualization')
plt.show()
```

The output appears directly below the code cell, making it easy to iterate on your analysis.

<Accordion title="Machine Learning Sample" icon="robot">

<Card
  title="Scikit-Learn Classifier Comparison"
  icon="flask"
  href="https://labex.io/labs/ml-scikit-learn-classifier-comparison-49080"

Example of machine learning workflow:

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y)

# Train model
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate
score = model.score(X_test, y_test)
print(f"Model accuracy: {score:.2f}")
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="How do I install additional Python packages?" icon="box">

You can install additional packages using pip in a code cell:

```python
!pip install package-name
```

Remember that installations are temporary and will be reset when your session ends.

<Accordion title="What are the essential keyboard shortcuts?" icon="keyboard">

Important Jupyter shortcuts:

- **Cell Execution**

  - Run Cell: Shift+Enter
  - Run Cell and Insert Below: Alt+Enter

- **Cell Operations**

  - Insert Cell Above: A
  - Insert Cell Below: B
  - Delete Cell: D,D (press twice)
  - Copy Cell: C

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why are educational notebooks different from regular lab content?" icon="graduation-cap">

Educational notebooks in LabEx are different from regular lab content:

1. Content is presented directly in the notebook
2. No step-by-step verification is available due to Jupyter's nature
3. You learn by:
   - Reading explanations in markdown cells
   - Running example code
   - Modifying code to experiment
   - Completing exercises within the notebook

This format allows for a more interactive and self-paced learning experience.
