## Skill Trees

Skill Trees are a collection of skills that are related to a specific topic. Each Skill Tree contains a set of labs and challenges that are organized into courses.

<Step title="Learn Labs">

Labs are hands-on learning experiences that allow you to practice your skills in a real-world environment. LabEx offers two types of labs:

- **LAB**: A lab is a guided learning experience that includes step-by-step instructions.
- **CHALLENGE**: A challenge is a hands-on learning experience that requires you to solve a problem without step-by-step instructions.

You can start a lab by clicking on the `Start` button.

When you start a lab, LabEx will automatically create a new [Virtual Machine (VM)](/using-labex/virtual-machine.mdx) for you. You can follow the instructions in the lab to practice in the VM.

</Step>

<Step title="Unlock Skills">

Each lab and challenge is associated with a set of skills. Completing a lab or challenge illuminates the corresponding skills, and lighting up the entire Skill Tree indicates proficiency in that area.

After you unlock all the skills in a Skill Tree:

- You'll receive a [Certificate of Completion](/labex-pro/certificates-of-completion).
- We will [Plant a Real Tree](/using-labex/green-learn-program) on your behalf.

</Step>
