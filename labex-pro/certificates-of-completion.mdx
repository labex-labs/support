## Earning Your Certificate

You will only receive a certificate if you have completed all of the labs (includes all labs, challenges and projects) in the course or acquire 60% skills in the [Skill Tree](/using-labex/quick-start#skill-trees). Once you've earned a certificate, you can add your full name directly to it.

## Accessing Your Certificate

Find and download your certificates anytime from your My Profile page (click on your avatar) or the respective Course or [Skill Tree](/using-labex/quick-start#skill-trees) page.

## Eligibility

Certificates are exclusive to LabEx Pro members at the time of course or [Skill Tree](/using-labex/quick-start#skill-trees) completion. Free accounts with Basic Plan are not eligible for certificates. However, once earned, you can access your certificate even if your Pro membership ends.

## Checking Certificate Availability

To determine if a course or [Skill Tree](/using-labex/quick-start#skill-trees) offers a certificate, visit its Overview or Syllabus page. Some courses or Skill Trees might not grant certificates if they're still in development or in a beta phase.
