## What are Credits and How to Use Them?

- **Purpose of Credits:** Credits are exclusively used for [Alibaba Cloud Labs](https://labex.io/alibaba). Each Alibaba Cloud Lab consumes a specific number of credits.
- **Acquiring Credits:** You can purchase credits via PayPal or redeem them using vouchers provided by Alibaba Cloud instructors.

## Checking Your Credit Balance and Recharging

- **Viewing and Recharging Credits:** To view your credit balance and recharge history, go to the 'My Profile' page accessible from the dropdown under your avatar. Then, click to enter the 'Credits' page.
- **Recharging Process:** You can recharge your credits on this page using PayPal. The rate for purchasing credits is $1 for 10 credits.

## Why Are Alibaba Cloud Lab Attempts Limited?

- **Limitation Due to Costs:** Due to cost considerations, Alibaba Cloud labs are typically restricted to a single attempt by default.
- **Accessing Labs:** Once you pay the required credits, you'll gain access to a lab for one attempt.
- **Additional Attempts:** If you wish to repeat the lab after completing it, you will need to pay the credits for that lab again.
- **Unlimited Access to Documentation:** However, you can view the lab documentation as many times as you like without any restrictions.
